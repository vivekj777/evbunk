        <h1>EV BUNK</h1><br><br>
        <p>Transportation electrification is an important component of future smart city design, and electric vehicles (EVs)
            will be smoothly incorporated into the system. Charging stations are the primary source of energy for electric
            vehicles, and their location is crucial for EV accessibility in cities. They should be strategically placed so that an
            electric vehicle may access a charging station within its driving range and then travel around the city once charged.
            In this study, we propose the Electric Vehicle Charging Slot Booking, which aims to reduce the EV charging station
            line. The proposed EV Charging mobile app system will give EV car owners the convenience of finding charging
            stations on a Google map, as well as charging slot availability.</p>
